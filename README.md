# Hi, I'm Humair 👋

## 💻 About Me
- 🎓 Software Engineering student at the University of Stirling  
- 🦀 Learning Rust with a focus on systems programming  
- 🔒 Exploring cybersecurity, networking, and packet-level analysis  
- 🐧 Linux enthusiast (Arch, Gentoo, Pop!_OS ricing included)

## 📘 What I'm Working On
- Building a modular **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**  
  ↳ Rust for packet sniffing  
  ↳ Python for anomaly detection

- Practising Rust fundamentals through small utilities and structured learning  

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Rust (ownership, lifetimes, concurrency, crates)  
- Linux internals & system administration  
- Networking concepts used in security  
- Python for data processing and ML (for NIDS)

## 🎯 Future Goals
- Build my first Rust-based security tool  
- Contribute to open-source Linux or security projects  
- Move into the cybersecurity + Rust systems space
